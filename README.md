# Post office employee management system.
Our team has developed a Post Office Employee Management System using
Python programming language with the help of tkinter and sqlite3. The main
purpose of this project is to efficiently manage and maintain employee records for
a post office. This project is to keep hold of the loan details of the employee taken
under the Indian postal scheme of 1981
Sqlite3 is used to implement MySQL queries in real-time, which enables us to
create a table named "postoffice" and generate an SQL file. Tkinter is used for
designing the user interface, making it user-friendly and easy to navigate.
The project has been implemented using cursors, which is a database object used to
execute SQL statements in Python. We used a cursor object con.cursor() to
implement several functions in the application program. We also imported a
PL/SQL file into our Python file to implement employee management functions.
The project includes a login page for administrative purposes with default values
set to 'Tamogh' and password as '123', or 'Vikram' and '123'. Once logged in, the
admin has access to six functions, including Add Client, Modify, Search, Contact,
About, and Backup.
The Add Client function allows the admin to add details of a new client, including
account number, account name, denomination, months paid up to, and the next RD
installment due date. The Modify function enables the admin to modify an existing
employee's details using the same attributes.
The Search function is used to fetch an employee's details, and Contact and About
provide information about the project and its developers. Finally, the Backup
function is used to backup any changes made to the database.
Overall, the Post Office Employee Management System provides an efficient and
user-friendly solution for managing employee records in a post office environment
